    <h1>Pock Mortys Full list of mortys ranked</h1>
    <p>All data presented on this page was derived from the tables on the official pocket mortys website
        <a href="https://pocketmortys.net/mortys/">here on pocketmortys.net</a>
    </p>
    <p>I will do my best to update the content here on time, no guarantees. </p>

    <h2>Meaning : </h2>

    <p>
        The combined score of each morty is his base HP plus the stat total. Mortys are ranked in order based on their
        combined score.
    </p>
    <p>
        I ignore the Base XP stat which is used to calculate how many experience points your mortys gain when you
        battle a morty with that XP stat.
    </p>
    <p>
        This data is meant as a guide for discovering which mortys are actually strongest within the game. When you
        are starting out it's difficult to know that an evil rabbit morty is a weak ass POS, while shirt mortys which
        initially seem weak combine to form rainbow shirt morty, one of the strongest possible paper type mortys (and
        tough as hell to beat).
    </p>

        Please read on at the bottom of the page for more advice / tips.

    <h2>Advice :</h2>
    <p>
        Disclaimer : knowing a morty's combined score does not guarantee it will win in battle against another morty of
        lower or comparable score. Other factors need to be accounted for such as :
    <ul>
        <li>does this morty have any special attacks (ie. paralyze)</li>
        <li>what is the morty's strongest attack</li>
        <li>obviously types are important as well</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, even though OTM (one true morty) has the highest stats and HP overall, he doesn't gain a strong
        offensive attack until level 42 (golden touch). Many users are initially dissappointed with their OTM and
        abandon him, not knowing he ultimately becomes much stronger than any other morty in the game.
    </p>
    <p>
        Mortys that are evolved using level up mega seeds or by combinig are generally weaker than mortys you level up
        by battling. My best advice on how to trounce everyone and everything in the entire game is as follows :
        <ul>
            <li>Catch the strongest mortys you can early in the game and level them up by battling.</li>
            <li>eg. If you are lucky enough to find a hammer head morty early on, stick with him.</li>
            <li>Basically any morty in the top ~20 on this page should qualify.</li>
            <li>Do not neglect your regular morty, he can't be taken off your team</li>
            <li>Level up mega seeds are pretty much useless, instead choose normal defense / attack / speed seeds</li>
            <li>This last bit is works out because :
                <ol>
                    <li>As I said level up seeds produce poorer results on the whole and</li>
                    <li>Stat increasing seeds gains stick with your morty even as it levels up</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Since you can't remove regular morty from your team, use every stat increasing seed you get on him -
            except level up seeds, you need them to hatch OTM.</li>
            <li>Once you can buy stat increasing seeds start spending all your extra dough on those suckers and make
            your normal morty invincible. </li>
            <li>I believe these become available after about 20 badges.
                See <a href="https://pocketmortys.net/items">the items section here on pocketmortys.net</a> for details.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        Admittedly, this strategy is tough to follow in the first couple levels when you have nothing, but it helps
        a lot once you get cooking.
    </p>
    <p>
        Similarly after you have beat the game and are probably flush with schmeckles you can buy
        all the stat increasing seeds you need and make any morty tough as hell.
    </p>
    <p>
        Want to know what my deck is after all this research? SURE! Glad you asked. My current deck is not my
        <i>ideal</i> deck, but it's pretty damn good :
        <ul>
            <li>Morty (fully souped up with stat increasing seeds)</li>
            <li>OTM</li>
            <li>Cowboy Morty</li>
            <li>Psychokinetic Morty</li>
            <li>Super Unicorn Morty</li>
        </ul>
